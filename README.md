# US-State-SVGs
This repository contains a collection of solid-colored, high quality SVG files for the outlines of the US States. It also contains the python code used to generate the SVG files. The Python code uses Beautiful Soup to scrape the web for a collection of SVGs that were deemed not useful due to their coloring. It then modifies the SVG files to create solid-colored SVGs for each US state.
