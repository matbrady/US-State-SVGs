# US-State-SVGs
This repository contains the python code used to generate the SVG files and the SVG files themselves. The Python code uses Beautiful Soup to scrape the web for a collection of SVGs that were deemed not useful due to their coloring. It then modifies the SVG files to create solid-colored SVGs for each US state.
